## Introduction
This project showcases the exceptional work done by the Anna Mood Studio practice projects team. Our goal was to create a visually stunning and responsive website that effectively presents Anna Mood Studio's portfolio, services, testimonials, about us, and contact sections. We aimed to accurately reflect the studio's unique style, aesthetic, and expertise, inviting visitors to explore and engage with the captivating world of Anna Mood Studio.

## Project Results
We achieved remarkable results through effective communication, collaboration, and dedicated effort. We spent 24 hours in project meetings, demonstrating our commitment to productive teamwork. We completed the final product within six weeks, including thorough testing, despite challenges such as time constraints and resource limitations. The support of our colleagues and mentors, along with persistence and prioritization of the Minimum Viable Product, helped us overcome these challenges.

## Website Overview
The Anna Mood Studio website features a responsive design that seamlessly adapts to various devices, ensuring accessibility and visual appeal across platforms. We utilized pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the website, incorporating Swiper.js for improved mobile experience. Key features include:

- Scrollbar in the "About" section for better readability.
- Intuitive Swiper.js slider for easy navigation through the portfolio section.
- Custom modal windows for the project section, enabling access to image galleries with a simple click.
- Interactive Swiper.js display for testimonials, showcasing client feedback.
- Links to Anna's social media platforms for seamless integration with her online presence.
- Clickable email and phone options for users to contact Anna.
- Logo click functionality in the navigation bar to swiftly return to the top of the page for improved navigation convenience.

## Design Evolution
Throughout the iterative process, we aimed to create a visually captivating and engaging experience for both website users and Anna. We ensured the designs met Anna's expectations, making necessary adjustments and enhancements along the way.

## Project Scope
Understanding our capabilities and time constraints, we utilized the MoSCoW Method, a prioritization technique, to define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). While some features like multiple language support and subpages for interior design portfolio projects were excluded from the final implementation, we remained focused on delivering a high-quality product within the given constraints.

## Technical Setup
For development, we relied on the following technologies:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The building blocks of our project.
- Swiper.js: A modern and free touch slider used to enhance the mobile experience.

## Team Experience
Initially uncertain, our team found our roles and became valuable members through the support of mentors and agile practices. We dedicated ourselves to hard work and embraced changes throughout the project to enhance teamwork. The respectful and supportive atmosphere greatly contributed to our success.

## Future Plans
We have successfully achieved our project goal of learning to work as a team, acquiring new skills, and creating a functional real-world website. We provided Anna with the finalized designs, SEO-optimized text in English and Latvian, and comprehensive guidelines for managing the website going forward.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who contributed to this incredible journey. Together, we have accomplished something remarkable, and we are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.
